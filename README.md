# DoritoMenu
The Dorito Menu

## Development
To get started, you need to first install Meteor.js on your system. Meteor supports Windows, OSX, and Linux. We highly recommend first checking out the [Meteor Tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app) before diving into heavy development.

Check out https://www.meteor.com/install on how to get Meteor up and running on your system.

1. Install meteor
2. Clone this repo to your hard disk
3. Type "meteor"
4. You're done!
```
git clone https://github.com/ElDewrito/DoritoMenu.git
cd DoritoMenu
meteor
```
Once Meteor is up and running, you should be able to visit it at http://localhost:3000/

Any changes you make will update in real time! This makes development very fast, and keeps the creative flow running.

### Code Style and Editors
Please use 4 spaces for tabs. Set your editor to space 4 times when you hit Tab. Sublime should do this by default.

Most of us use Sublime Text 3 with a few plugins. You can install plugins by using the [Sublime Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) plugin.

For HTML, CSS, and Javascript you should download the Html Prettify plugin.

#### Through [Sublime Package Manager](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)

* `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` in Linux/Windows/OS X
* type `install`, select `Package Control: Install Package`
* type `prettify`, select `HTML-CSS-JS Prettify`

You should also install Meteor Snippets
* type `meteor`, select `Meteor Snippets`

You can use LESS as a CSS replacement, as Meteor will compile less at run time.
